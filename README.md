Update-Library
==============

A customizable java library used to update software. All you have to do is update is provide the library with access to two files on your web server one being the software version (for example: http://mydomain.com/software/projects/server/version.txt or a slightly more complex php script with multiple projects) and the second being the file to update to. The library will do the rest and is accompanied by a nice GUI.
